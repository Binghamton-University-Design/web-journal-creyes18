					<h2>Project 3: Article Illustrations </h2>

					<h3> Giving Up One Food Will Help your Health -- and the Planet
					</h3>

					<p><img src="images/Article-3_Reyes.gif"></p>
					<p> This article simply discussed the benefits of decreasing the amount of red meats that we consume, as well as its benefit towards mother earth. Consuming red meat in our regular diet, increases the risk of death. Studies showed that red meat impacted the environment most in comparison to chicken, eggs, fish and dairy products.</p>
					<p>

					For this article I decided to make mother earth the center of attention. I wanted to physically show an individual throwing out the use of the red meat. Therefore, with less consumers, mother earth and humans will both be benefited from this action. 
					 </p>




					<h3>
					95 percent of baby foods tested contain toxic metals</a>
					</h3>

					<h2>Project 2:  Scalable Icon</h2>
					<p><img class="icon" src="images/icons/Icons-01.png
						
					"></p>
					<p>Project two includes three icons that helps represent my individuality. I have developed two versions, one in which is in color and the other in monochrome. I have decided to include my love for fashion, as well as my interest in music and knitting. I decided to incorporate heels as my main image to show my love for shoes. I've always had difficulty feeling comfortable in the way I walk in heels, so I decided it was a great way of incorporating my love for fashion and growth of learning how to walk. Secondly, I chose to incorporate my love for music by creating a record player. I love old school music and the use of old devices. Using iphones as our source of music, takes away from the authentic vibe experience. When I am able to chose a record and play it, I enjoy my experience immensely. Lastly, I embraced my love for knitting in my last piece. I created a ball of yarn flowing freely.

					<h2>Project 1: 
						Isometric Avatar</h2>
					<p><img id="avatar" src="images/isometric avatar/IsometricAvatar.png"></p>
					<p>Project one is an isometric avatar design which portrays an aspect of life. I found designing myself a challenging. However, after doing some research I was able to find isometric examples that helped me create my figure. My avatar is displayed running and listening to music, which is one of the few physical activities I reach to do daily.
